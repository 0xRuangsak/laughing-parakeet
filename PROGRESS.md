# Project Progress Log

This document tracks the chronological development of the blockchain container project, including accomplishments, issues, and next steps.

## Timeline

### 2025-07-05: Initial Project Setup

#### Conversation Start
- User requested blockchain experimentation environment using geth
- Initial assumption: Ubuntu base with pre-installed tools
- **Course Correction**: User challenged assumptions, requested discussion before implementation

#### Requirements Gathering
- **Platform**: Mac with Docker Compose V2 (`docker compose` not `docker-compose`)
- **Base Image**: Discussed options (Ubuntu, Alpine, Debian, official Geth image)
- **Access Method**: SSH vs docker exec discussion
- **Installation Strategy**: Pre-install vs manual installation debate
- **Workflow**: Background vs foreground container operation

#### Key Decisions Made
- Alpine Linux base for minimal footprint
- SSH access as root, no password for simplicity
- Manual installation philosophy - nothing pre-installed
- Foreground container workflow (no `-d` flag)
- Manual block creation for precise control
- Container-native storage (no host mounts)

#### Artifacts Created
1. **Dockerfile**: Minimal Alpine + SSH configuration
2. **docker-compose.yml**: Single service container orchestration
3. **README.md**: Comprehensive documentation with user context
4. **DECISIONS.md**: Architecture decisions and rationale
5. **PROGRESS.md**: This timeline document

#### Current Status: READY FOR TESTING
- All configuration files created
- Documentation complete with LLM context
- User can proceed with: `docker compose build && docker compose up`

## Accomplishments

### ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Platform requirements clarified (Mac + Docker Compose V2)
- [x] Base image selected and justified (Alpine Linux)
- [x] Access method implemented (SSH as root, no password)
- [x] Container workflow defined (foreground + separate terminal)
- [x] Installation strategy established (manual, learning-focused)
- [x] Block creation approach defined (manual mining)
- [x] Documentation created with full context for future LLMs
- [x] Project structure defined with separation of concerns

### üèóÔ∏è In Progress
- User testing of container setup
- Manual geth installation inside container
- Blockchain initialization and first blocks

### üìã Next Steps (User Actions Required)
1. Create project directory and save files
2. Build and start container: `docker compose build && docker compose up`
3. SSH into container: `ssh root@localhost -p 2222`
4. Install geth manually inside container
5. Initialize blockchain with genesis block
6. Create accounts and start experimenting
7. Test manual block creation workflow

## Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Initial Over-Assumption
**Problem**: Jumped to implementation without understanding user preferences
**Solution**: Established discussion-first approach, gathered requirements properly
**Learning**: Always clarify requirements before implementation

### Issue: Docker Compose Syntax
**Problem**: Assumed old `docker-compose` syntax would work
**Solution**: Confirmed user needs `docker compose` (V2) for Mac compatibility
**Learning**: Platform-specific tooling requirements are critical

### Issue: Background vs Foreground Confusion
**Problem**: Initially suggested `-d` flag despite user preferring foreground
**Solution**: Corrected documentation to reflect foreground + new terminal workflow
**Learning**: Pay attention to user's explicit workflow preferences

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements
- **Multi-node setup**: Create additional containers for network experimentation
- **Port expansion**: Add geth RPC/WebSocket ports for external tool connections
- **Development tools**: Install Node.js, Solidity compiler, web3 libraries as needed
- **External integrations**: Connect Remix IDE, MetaMask, or custom web3 applications
- **Monitoring tools**: Add blockchain explorers or analytics dashboards

### Learning Opportunities
- Smart contract deployment and testing workflows
- Gas optimization and transaction analysis
- Network consensus mechanisms experimentation
- DeFi protocol development and testing
- Custom blockchain parameter tuning

### Technical Debt
- None currently - clean minimal setup as designed
- Future: May need to optimize for development workflow as usage patterns emerge

## Status Summary

**Current Phase**: Ready for initial user testing  
**Blocking Issues**: None  
**Risk Level**: Low  
**Next Milestone**: Successful geth installation and first blockchain initialization

**For Future LLMs**: This project is ready for user experimentation. All foundational decisions have been made and documented. Focus should be on helping with geth installation, blockchain setup, and smart contract development workflows.
