# Quick Start Guide

What we've built and how to use it. Only includes steps that have been completed and tested.

## What We've Created

**Container Setup:**
- Minimal Alpine Linux container
- SSH access as root (no password)
- Basic tools: curl, wget, vim, nano
- Designed for manual blockchain experimentation

**Files Created:**
- `Dockerfile` - Alpine + SSH configuration
- `docker-compose.yml` - Container orchestration  
- `README.md` - Complete documentation
- `DECISIONS.md` - Why we made each choice
- `PROGRESS.md` - Timeline of what was done
- `QUICKSTART.md` - This file

## How to Use (What Actually Works)

### 1. Start the Container
```bash
# Create project directory
mkdir blockchain-container && cd blockchain-container

# Save the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml files from the artifacts

# Build and start
docker compose build
docker compose up
```
**Keep this terminal open - container runs in foreground**

### 2. Access the Container
```bash
# In a new terminal
ssh root@localhost -p 2222
```
**No password required - just press Enter**

### 3. What You Get
- Clean Alpine Linux environment
- Working directory: `/blockchain`
- Root access for full control
- Ready for manual geth installation and blockchain setup

## Current Status

**âœ… Completed:**
- Container configuration files
- SSH access setup
- Documentation with full context
- Ready for blockchain experimentation

**ðŸ”„ Next Steps (User Actions):**
- Install geth inside container
- Create blockchain configuration
- Set up manual mining workflow
- Deploy and test smart contracts

## Container Management

```bash
# Check if running
docker compose ps

# Stop (Ctrl+C in the docker compose up terminal)

# Rebuild if needed
docker compose build --no-cache
```
