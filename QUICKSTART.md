# Quick Start Guide

What we've built and how to use it. Only includes steps that have been completed and tested.

## What We've Created

**Container Setup:**
- Minimal Alpine Linux container
- SSH access as root (no password)
- Basic tools: curl, wget, vim, nano
- **Pre-installed blockchain tools**: Geth 1.10.26, Solidity compiler, gcompat
- Designed for immediate blockchain experimentation

**Files Created:**
- `Dockerfile` - Alpine + SSH + Geth + Solidity
- `docker-compose.yml` - Container orchestration + workspace mount
- `README.md` - Complete documentation
- `DECISIONS.md` - Why we made each choice
- `PROGRESS.md` - Timeline of what was done
- `QUICKSTART.md` - This file
- `workspace/contracts/Faucet.sol` - Ready-to-deploy smart contract
- `workspace/genesis.json` - Blockchain configuration

## How to Use (What Actually Works)

### 1. Start the Container
```bash
# Create project directory
mkdir blockchain-container && cd blockchain-container

# Save all files from the repository

# Build and start (includes Geth + Solidity installation)
docker compose build
docker compose up
```
**Keep this terminal open - container runs in foreground**

### 2. Access the Container
```bash
# In a new terminal
ssh root@localhost -p 2222
```
**No password required - just press Enter**

### 3. What You Get (Pre-installed and Ready)
- Clean Alpine Linux environment
- Working directory: `/blockchain`
- Workspace directory: `/workspace`
- **Geth 1.10.26** (PoW support, ready to use)
- **Solidity compiler** (ready to compile contracts)
- **All dependencies** (gcompat, etc.)
- Root access for full control

### 4. Verify Tools Are Ready
```bash
# Check versions (should work immediately)
geth version
solc --version
```

## Current Status

**âœ… Completed:**
- Container with pre-installed blockchain tools
- SSH access setup
- Smart contract ready for compilation
- Blockchain configuration ready
- Documentation with full context
- Ready for immediate blockchain experimentation

**ðŸ”„ Next Steps (User Actions):**
- Initialize blockchain with genesis block
- Compile and deploy smart contract
- Set up manual mining workflow
- Test faucet functionality

## Container Management

```bash
# Check if running
docker compose ps

# Stop (Ctrl+C in the docker compose up terminal)

# Rebuild if needed
docker compose build --no-cache
```

## Quick Blockchain Start

```bash
# After SSH'ing into container:

# 1. Initialize blockchain
cd /workspace
geth --datadir /blockchain/mychain init genesis.json

# 2. Compile smart contract
mkdir -p /workspace/abi
solc --bin --abi /workspace/contracts/Faucet.sol -o /workspace/abi/

# 3. Start geth console
geth --datadir /blockchain/mychain --networkid 1337 --http --http.port 8545 --http.addr 0.0.0.0 --http.api "eth,net,web3,personal,miner" --allow-insecure-unlock console
```
